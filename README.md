## üîí API Security

### Key Security Measures

**Authentication**
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless user authentication
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt
- Session management with secure cookie handling

**Authorization**
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- Permission checks on all API endpoints
- Property-level authorization ensuring users can only access their own data

**Rate Limiting**
- Request throttling per user/IP to prevent API abuse
- Different limits for authenticated vs unauthenticated users
- Separate rate limits for sensitive endpoints like login and payment

**Data Protection**
- Input validation and sanitization on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention using ORM and parameterized queries
- XSS protection through proper content encoding

**Payment Security**
- PCI DSS compliance for all payment processing
- Tokenization of sensitive payment data
- No storage of raw credit card information

### Security Importance by Area

**User Data Protection**
Crucial for maintaining user privacy, preventing identity theft, and complying with data protection regulations like GDPR. Breaches could lead to legal consequences and loss of user trust.

**Payment Security**
Essential for financial safety and PCI compliance. Any vulnerability could result in direct financial losses for users and severe reputational damage to the platform.

**Booking Integrity**
Prevents fraudulent bookings, double-booking attacks, and ensures fair access to properties. Security failures could disrupt the core business functionality.

**Property Management**
Protects host information and prevents unauthorized modifications to property listings. Compromises could lead to fake listings or host account takeovers.

**Review System Authenticity**
Ensures only genuine guests can leave reviews, maintaining the credibility of the rating system. Without security, the review system becomes unreliable.
